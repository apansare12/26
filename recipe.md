# pancakes 

Ingredients for pancake mix 
6 cups (940 g) all-purpose flour
1/3 cup (77 g) granulated sugar
3 tablespoons baking powder
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons kosher salt

Ingredients for pancakes
1 cup pancake mix
3/4 cup milk, or 1 cup buttermilk
1 large egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon melted butter, plus more for the pan

Method
In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk together.
Put 1 cup of mix into a medium mixing bowl. In a separate small mixing bowl, combine milk, egg, and vanilla extract. Beat the egg with a fork or whisk until itâ€™s well incorporated with the milk and extract. Continue whisking the milk while you pour in the melted butter.

Pour the egg mixture into the bowl with the pancake mix. Use a spatula to stir to combine.
Pour 1/3 cup of pancake batter onto the skillet to form a pancake
Once bubbles form on the top and the edges of the pancake look slightly drier than the middle, flip the pancake. You should cook the pancake for about 3 minutes on the first side and 1 to 2 minutes after flipping. The pancakes should be lightly golden on both sides, with crispy edges.
Serve with maple syrup or powdered sugar and fruit. If feeding a crowd, keep warm on a plate in a low oven until ready to serve.
